To complete the second milestone, each team must successfully complete the following steps:

- Efficient data loading (can be done in one step for small databases, and with generator or streaming for larger databases).

- Baseline model (should be a simpler, easier to understand model, e.g. rule-based, linear/logistic regression, simple neural network, etc.)

- Training (it's OK if it is not precise enough, or does not converge, but you should be able to overfit it).

- Evaluation (evaluating of the baseline and the 0 using metrics or metrics commonly used in the field).

By the end of the second milestone, you should have the complete modeling pipeline ready. So, for the final submission you should improve certain parts and work on the front-end UI.

Upload the solution to the GitHub repo you created earlier, where you should include these in README.md along with the previous ones: 

- how to run the pipeline.

- how to train the models,

- how to evaluate the models.
