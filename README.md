## **Description:**
In this project, you'll dive into the idea of using multiple models together, known as model ensembles, to make our deep learning solutions more accurate. They are a reliable approach to improve accuracy of a deep learning solution for the added cost of running multiple networks. Using ensembles is a trick that's widely used by the winners of AI competitions. Task of the students: explore approaches to model ensemble construction for semantic segmentation, select a dataset (preferentially cardiac MRI segmentation, but others also allowed), find an open-source segmentation solution as a baseline for the selected dataset and test it. Train multiple models and construct an ensemble from them. Analyse the improvements, benefits and added costs of using an ensemble.

**Difficulty:** medium

## **Repository**

Currently we are facing a problem concerning the data files. The files are too large and we cannot upload them to GitHub.

You can access the original file at: https://www.cardiacatlas.org/sunnybrook-cardiac-data/

Our modified datafiles can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZfMrP214ZHfaliZqskRgOYZ4WXjPdlMB/view?usp=sharing

For now, until we solve this problem you can use our project with the test batch we uploaded to GitHub. Currently you can find it in the *.ipynb_checkpoints* folder.

With this you should be able to run the *Cardiac MRI segmentation-checkpoint.ipynb*.
